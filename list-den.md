## Change Data Capture

Change Data Capture consists in reading the binary log, continuously or periodically. The purpose is keeping track of data changes, to generate events or to keep a copy of the data up to date (as it happens with replication). A program that reads the binary log is called a consumer.

Some of these projects are complete data flow platforms that are able to consume the MariaDB binary log. Others are just log consumers that support the MariaDB binary log.

Most MySQL binary log consumers tend to work with MariaDB, but they might encounter several differences that will prevent them from parsing the logs correctly:

 - MariaDB GTID and MySQL GTID have different formats;
 - MariaDB has additional data types;
 - Both MariaDB and MySQL have unique features, like MariaDB invisible columns;
 - MariaDB has options that cause the binary log to include additional information, making it different from MySQL binary log.

## Data Integration

The following resources show how to integrate MariaDB with various other data technologies. Resources are grouped by technology type (eg: social networks) and ordered by technology (eg: Facebook, Twitter...). Resources might refer to a particular third party tool, in which case the tool name is indicated before the resource title.

**From Social Networks**

## Key

Meaning of the terms used in this list.

### MariaDB Support

Some of the sections include resources that were created for MySQL, or for both MariaDB and MySQL. The extent of MariaDB support is not always optimal. For those resources, we indicate the MariaDB support level as follows:

- `YES`: Specific support for MariaDB is indicated, or can be inferred from the documentation or the source code. "Supports MySQL/MariaDB" is not considered specific MariaDB support, because the author might assume that what works on MySQL will work on MariaDB equally well.
- `MySQL`: Officially supports MySQL, but not MariaDB.
- `NOT VERIFIED`: Officially supports MySQL and MariaDB but we do not know whether full support for MariaDB is implemented.
- `PARTIAL`: We are aware of relevant bugs or missing features.

If you disagree about a project's MariaDB Support indication, please report a bug.

### License

The license column might need a better name.

- `Cloud` - Available as a cloud service.
- `Proprietary` - Source is available, but software is not Open Source.
- `Open Source` - The license is [approved by OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses).
- For software that uses a single, open source, well-known license we sometimes indicate the license name.

For non-cloud software, we ancourage you to verify the license where relevant. Indicating a specific license is usually a simplification, because an application could be distributed with multiple licenses, or it might include libraries that use different licenses.
